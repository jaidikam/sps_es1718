As the number of people living in the world has been drastically increasing ... ensuring access to sufficient amount of food has becom an increasingly tough
challenge for a large parts of the population, especially for people living in developing countries[see OCED paper].
As pointed out by Erokhin 2017 an important factor contributing to food security are food prices, as well as economic and climatic
conditions and political stability.
The OECD has identified a set of factors influencing crop prices. This paper copes with the influence on crop prices on domestic markets in 
selected developing countries. The goal is to find out to which extent the OECDs findings are also applicable to India,
Rwanda and the Phillipines.
Find most important variables in each dataset
Similarities, differences, etc


Theory and design:

Workflow, maybe somthg like a progressbar, link to quantlets


    ...
    ...

    describe techniques, with formulas


After putting together  information from various different sources, these are the datasets that the analysis was conducted with:
  
Country
  variable name   Data type     range     NAs     Description      
  
Graphs for each country showing developments, trends, global development as comparison, etc
Table of functions:
  name    purpose     input data       output data      comment



Implementation:

    
Show and describe most important lines of code in every step of the analysis
etc



Conclusion

we can confirm the genereal direction of the OECDs findings, however...
